# Quest Help

Quest Help  is a website that allows the user to log and track their tasks and goals with added notification timers and points that they can allocate to each task. The more you complete, the more xp you get!

NOTE: To log into the site, we added a user authentication feature. The credentials are:
User: admin
Pass: 1234

Besides that, there are no active dependencies nor installations needed to access the site. Feel free to play around!
